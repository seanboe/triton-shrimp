          <h2>game</h2>
          <p>Oceans11 is a fun google maps-based guessing game. The player is randomly spawned into one of 11 coastal places in the world and is able to view the location in 360 degrees. Then, they have 60 seconds to guess where they are in the world with an interactive position marking system. Based on the distance between the actual location and their guess, they receive points, making this a fun game to play with others! Playing again is as simple as clicking "play again," and the player will spawn in a new location with 60 more seconds. </p>
          <p>To teach our players about ocean conservation, each of the spawnable locations are related to ocean health or science. On the answer page, each map has a short description that includes specific background information about the location's relevance to ocean conservation efforts around the world. These include beaches where important research was conducted, coasts littered with trash, and places where illegal fishing is common. Thus, our game is more than just a game; it is an interactive instructional tool that informs players about the importance of ocean conservation around the world, from India and the Philippines to Africa and even our own Torrey Pines.</p>
